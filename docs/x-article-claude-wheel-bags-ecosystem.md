# Claude Wheel: Autonomous Market-Making for the Bags.fm Ecosystem

## The Problem Every Token Creator Faces

You've launched your token on Bags.fm. The community is growing. Trading is happening. Fees are accumulating in your dev wallet.

But here's the reality:
- Claiming fees manually is tedious and time-consuming
- Keeping your chart active requires constant attention
- Dead charts kill momentum faster than anything else
- Managing multiple wallets 24/7 is exhausting

What if there was a way to automate all of this?

## Enter Claude Wheel

Claude Wheel is an autonomous market-making platform built specifically for tokens in the Bags.fm ecosystem. Think of it as your token's autopilot—collecting fees, executing trades, and maintaining chart activity around the clock.

**Connect your token once. Let the flywheel work forever.**

## How The Flywheel Works

At the core of Claude Wheel is a simple but powerful mechanism: the perpetual flywheel.

### Step 1: Automatic Fee Collection
Every 30 seconds, Claude Wheel monitors your dev wallet for accumulated trading fees. When fees reach the 0.15 SOL threshold, the system automatically claims them.

### Step 2: Fee Distribution
Claimed fees are split:
- **90%** flows to your ops wallet (used for market-making)
- **10%** platform fee (keeps Claude Wheel running)

### Step 3: The 5-Buy/5-Sell Cycle
Your ops wallet SOL powers the market-making engine:

**Phase 1 (Buy):** Execute 5 sequential buy orders with randomized amounts within your configured range. Accumulate tokens.

**Phase 2 (Sell):** Execute 5 sequential sell orders, distributing accumulated tokens evenly.

**Repeat.** Forever.

This creates consistent, visible trading activity on your chart—demonstrating market interest and attracting organic traders.

## Three Algorithm Modes

Claude Wheel offers three distinct trading strategies:

### Simple Mode
Predictable, steady cycles. 5 buys followed by 5 sells with randomized amounts. Perfect for consistent chart activity without complexity.

### Smart Mode
Data-driven trading powered by technical analysis:
- **RSI Analysis:** Buys when oversold (<30), sells when overbought (>70)
- **Bollinger Bands:** Detects price reversals at band extremes
- **EMA Crossover:** EMA-10 vs EMA-20 for trend identification
- **Volatility Detection:** Reduces position size during high volatility
- **Confidence Scoring:** Only executes trades above threshold

### Rebalance Mode
Maintains target portfolio allocations. If your SOL percentage exceeds your target, the system buys tokens. If tokens exceed target, it sells. Automatic portfolio management.
